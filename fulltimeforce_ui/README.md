# Information about the project

This project was created by Juan Ordosgoite.
It is a website with information about the most popular movies around the world. To get the data, it was used the TMBD API - https://www.themoviedb.org/  (First an account was created and then it was able to use the key for the API). When the user clicks on "DETAILS" to see the movie's details, it will get the data using the endpoint developed on the backend. So we get the info from the local database. The username example was included to show the use of localstorage.
